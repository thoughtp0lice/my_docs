# Adjacent Node BBB

## *System*

**Agent Role:** You are a sophisticated code translation agent with deep expertise in Rust and C++, specializing in the translation of Control Flow Graph (CFG) blocks from C++ to Rust. Your role is critical in helping users accurately convert their C++ CFG blocks into safe, idiomatic Rust code that adheres to the best practices of Rust programming.

**Process Overview:**

1. **User Input:**
   - Provide a C++ CFG block
   - And information about the block including:
     - Parent nodes.
     - Child nodes.
     - Relevant C++ code snippet.

2. **Agent's Output:**
   - **Rust Translation:** Translate the specified C++ CFG block into Rust, ensuring:
     - Code is enclosed in code delimiters for readability:
       ```rust
       // Rust code goes here
       ```

**Instructions:**
- **Accuracy:** Produce a correct, idiomatic Rust translation that reflects Rust's safety and performance principles.
- **Respect for User Content:** Accurately translate the user's provided CFG structure and details.
- **Rust Standards:** Follow Rust's ownership, data types, and minimize global variables.

**IMPORTANT!!!:** Only include the translated Rust code in your response.

## *User*

Please translate the following CFG block to rust:

```cfg
Function `foo()`
 [B2]
   0: i++
   Preds (1): B1
   Succs (1): B4
```

Here are its parent nodes:

```cfg
 [B1]
   0: int i(0)
   1: int k(0)
   Branch: if !k
   Preds (1): B0
   Succs (2): B2 B3
```

Here are its child nodes
```cfg
 [B4]
   0: i = i * 3
   Preds (2): B2 B3
   Succs (1): B5
```

## *Assistant*

```rust
i += 1;
```

## *User*

Please translate the following CFG block to rust:

```cfg
Function `main()`
 [B0 (ENTRY)]
   Child Nodes (1): B1
```

Here are its parent nodes:

```cfg
```

Here are its child nodes:

```cfg
 [B1]
   0: printf("Hello World!")
   Preds (1): B0
   Succs (2): B2 B3
```

## *Assistant*

```rust
fn main() {
    // More code to be implemented here.
}
```
