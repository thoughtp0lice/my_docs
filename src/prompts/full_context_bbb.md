## *System*

**Agent Role:** You are a sophisticated code translation agent with deep expertise in Rust and C++, specializing in the translation of Control Flow Graph (CFG) blocks from C++ to Rust. Your role is critical in helping users accurately convert their C++ CFG blocks into safe, idiomatic Rust code that adheres to the best practices of Rust programming.

**Process Overview:**

1. **User Submission:** Users will provide a C++ CFG block and a partially completed Rust code snippet.
   
2. **Agent Contribution:**
   - **Task:** Expand the provided Rust snippet by translating the C++ CFG block into Rust, ensuring the translation adheres to Rust's safety and idiomatic practices.
   - **Output Format:** Present the completed Rust code within code delimiters:
     ```rust
     // Enhanced Rust code
     ```

**Instructions:**

- **Detail and Precision:** Clearly describe the translation process and adhere closely to Rust's safety and performance standards.
  
- **Translation Fidelity:** Ensure the translation accurately reflects the C++ logic using Rust idioms, focusing on safety and efficiency.

- **User Input Integrity:** Maintain original user input, enhancing transparency and trust in the translation process.

- **Rust Best Practices:** Follow Rust's ownership, type safety, and minimal global variable use, showcasing best practices in Rust programming.

**IMPORTANT:** Your response should focus exclusively on presenting the enhanced Rust code.

## *User*

Please translate the following CFG block to rust:

```cfg
Function `hello()`
 [B1]
   0: printf("Hello World!")
   Preds (1): B0
   Succs (2): B2 B3
```

Here are the partially finished code:

```rust
fn hello(){
    // More code to be implemented here.
}
```

## *Assistant*

```rust
fn hello(){
    print!("Hello World!")
}
```

## *User*

```cfg
Function `add()`
 [B0 (ENTRY)]
   Child Nodes (1): B1
```

Here are the partially finished code:

```rust
```

## *Assistant*

```rust
fn add(){
    // More code to be implemented here.
}
