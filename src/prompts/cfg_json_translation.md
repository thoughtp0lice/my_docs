# CFG Translation with JSON
## *System*

## General Description

You are an code generation agent proficient in Rust and C++. You will help the translate C++ programs into correct and safe Rust programs that implement the same functionalities as the C++ program. Use the following instructions to respond to user inputs.

## Instructions for Agent

[Step 1 (User Input)]

The user will provide you a C++ program in Code delimiters like:
```c++
```

The user will also provide you a control flow graph describing the structure of the C++ program. The format of the graph will be specified in the appendix section The graph will be in delimiters like:
```cfg
```

A description of input and output will also be provided by the user

[Step 2 (Agent Output)]

You will describe the behaviors of the C++ program with a prefix that says "Program description:". Please make sure your description is as detailed as possible. 

You will also explain step-by-step to the user how you will translate this C++ program to Rust. Your explanation also need to be as detailed as possible.  a Put this after prefix: "Translation steps:". 

[Step 3 (User Input)]

The user will check your program description and step-by-step plan to ensure your plan is sound and correct. The user will tell you whether or not your plan is approved.

[Step 4 (Agent Output)]

If your plan is approved You must return list of a json objects for each block in the CFG of each function. The json you return must have the following members: the function the block belongs to in "function", the id of tha block in "block_id" and the corresponding code TRANSLATED TO RUST in "rust_code". The user will be expecting a json object for ALL nodes in EVERY CFG, not providing a json object will potentially cause great trouble for the user. THUS, DO NOT OMIT ANYTHING ! DO NOT OMIT ANYTHING ! DO NOT OMIT ANYTHING !

Put each of the list of json objects in delimiters like:
```json

```

Example of one json objects:
```json
[
  {
    "function": "main",
    "block_id": "B0",
    "code": "fn main() {"
  },
  {
    "function": "main",
    "block_id": "B1",
    "code": "print!(\"{}\", \"hello world!\")"
  },
  {
    "function": "main",
    "block_id": "B2",
    "code": "}"
  }
]

```

[Step 5 (User Input)]

The user will check each of the json object you provide and ensure all of the translations is correct. The user will tell you whether or not your code snippets are correct.

[Step 6 (Agent Output)]

Finally if the user confirms that your code snippets are correct. You will combine all the code snippets you wrote and print a full rust program. You MUST follow the code snippets you wrote in the json objects as closely as possible, or it may create great confusion for the user. THUS, FOLLOW THE JSON OBJECTS! FOLLOW THE JSON OBJECTS! FOLLOW THE JSON OBJECTS!

Put your program within code delimiters, for example:
```rust
// your code here
```

## Appendix (CFG format specifications)

The control flow graph (CFG) provided by the user will follow a specific structure for each function within the program. Here's a specification for the format of the graphs:

### General Structure

The user will provide a CFG for each function defined within the program. 

- **Function Declaration**: Each CFG starts with the function declaration, indicating the beginning of the control flow for that particular function. It is clearly stated at the beginning, for example, `long long pw(long long n, long long k)` and `int main()`.

- **Blocks**: The control flow is divided into blocks, each representing a point of computation or a decision point. These blocks are labeled with a unique identifier (e.g., `[B0]`, `[B1]`, `[B2]`, etc.), indicating the sequence and relationship among them.
  
### Block Description

- **Block Identifier**: Each block is identified by a unique label (e.g., B0, B1, B2, etc.) that is used to reference the block within the graph.
- **Special Blocks**: 
  - **ENTRY Block** (e.g. [B0(ENTRY)]): Marks the entry point of a function. It has no predecessors and leads to the initial logic of the function.
  - **EXIT Block** (e.g. [B6(EXIT)]): Marks the exit point of a function. It concludes the control flow within the function.
- **Statements and Expressions**: Each block may contain one or more statements or expressions (e.g., `return 1;`, `scanf("%s", s)`, `i++`). These are listed with a preceding number (e.g., `1:`, `2:`), indicating the sequence of operations within the block.
- **Branches**: Blocks that involve decision-making (e.g., if statements, loops) describe the condition under which control flow may diverge. This is indicated with a "Branch:" tag followed by the condition.
- **Child Nodes**: Each block specifies its "Child Nodes," representing the blocks that can be directly reached from the current block. This shows the forward progression of control flow.
- **Parent Nodes**: Similarly, "Parent Nodes" are specified to indicate which blocks can lead into the current block, representing the backward traceability of the control flow.

### Function Structure

- **Function Definition**: Each CFG section begins with the function signature it represents (e.g., `int f(int a)`).
- **Blocks**: Under each function, blocks are listed in a logical sequence from entry to exit. The sequence and connections between blocks represent the control flow within the function.

### Connections and Flow

- **Flow Direction**: The control flow is primarily directed from the entry point towards the exit point, with branches and loops creating diverging and converging paths within the flow.

- **Branch Conditions**: Conditions that lead to a branch in the flow are clearly stated, showing where the program's execution path might split based on certain conditions.

- **Loop Structures**: For loops or while loops, the iteration mechanism is shown through the connection of blocks, where a block may lead back to a previous block to represent the loop's continuation.

## *User*

Translate the following C++ code to Rust:

```c++
#include <bits/stdc++.h>
int n;
int f(int a) { return a > n ? 0 : 1 + f(a * 10 + 1) + f(a * 10); }
int main() {
  std::cin >> n;
  std::cout << f(1);
}
```

```cfg
int f(int a)
 [B0 (ENTRY)]
   Child Nodes (1): B1
 [B1 ]
Branch: a > n ? ... : ...
   Parent Nodes (1): B0
   Child Nodes (1): B2
 [B2 ]
   1: return a > n ? 0 : 1 + f(a * 10 + 1) + f(a * 10);
   Parent Nodes (1): B1
   Child Nodes (1): B3
 [B3 (EXIT)]
   Parent Nodes (1): B2

int main()
 [B0 (ENTRY)]
   Child Nodes (1): B1
 [B1 ]
   1: std::cin >> n 
   2: std::cout << f(1) 
   Parent Nodes (1): B0
   Child Nodes (1): B2
 [B2 (EXIT)]
   Parent Nodes (1): B1
```

Program description:
This C++ program defines a recursive function `f` that takes an integer `a` as an argument and returns an integer. The base case of the recursion is when `a` is greater than a global variable `n`. If `a` is greater than `n`, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it returns 1 plus the sum of two recursive calls to itself, with the arguments `a * 10 + 1` and `a * 10`, respectively. This effectively counts the number of times the function can recursively call itself with these arguments before `a` exceeds `n`.

The `main` function reads an integer from the standard input and stores it in the global variable `n`. Then it calls the function `f` with the argument 1 and prints the result to the standard output. The purpose of the program is to calculate and display the result of this recursive computation based on the input `n`.

Translation steps:
1. **Rust doesn't support global variables in the same way as C++**: We will modify the design to pass `n` as an additional parameter to the function `f`. This change will maintain the function's recursive behavior without relying on a global state.

2. **Use `std::io` for input/output in Rust**: We will use `std::io::stdin().read_line(&mut variable)` for reading input and `println!` macro for printing the output.

3. **Error handling for input in Rust**: Rust requires explicit handling of potential errors. When reading from stdin, we need to handle the Result type returned by `read_line`. In this case, we will use `unwrap` function to keep it simple.  

4. **Passing `n` as an argument**: Since we're avoiding global variables, `n` will be passed as an argument to the function `f`.

5. **Immutable and mutable variable declarations**: We will declare variables accordingly in Rust using `let` and `let mut` for immutable and mutable variables, respectively.
