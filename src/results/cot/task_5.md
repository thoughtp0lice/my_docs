### Attempt 1

**Result Summary**

Program description:
The given C++ program is designed to perform geometric transformations on a set of points that define a custom shape. The shape is defined relative to an initial point and then transformed based on input parameters. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

1. **Structure Definition**: A `point` structure is defined to represent a point in 2D space with `x` and `y` coordinates. It includes a constructor for initializing a point and a method `rotate` to rotate the point around the origin by a given angle.

2. **Operator Overloading**: The program overloads the `+` operator for the `point` structure, allowing for the addition of two points.

3. **Main Logic**:
    - Inputs are read: initial point (`px`, `py`), a direction vector (`vx`, `vy`), and dimensions `a`, `b`, `c`, `d` that describe the shape.
    - The shape is initially defined relative to the initial point and modified according to the dimensions. It's essentially a sequence of points (vertices of the shape) stored in a vector `ans`.
    - The initial point of the shape is moved, and this new starting point (`tmp`) is stored.
    - The shape undergoes a rotation transformation based on the angle of the direction vector relative to the negative y-axis (to align with the given direction vector) and then moved back to align with the original point plus any transformations.
    - Each transformed point is printed out with high precision.

Translation steps:
1. **Struct and Method Definitions in Rust**: Translate the `point` struct and its methods to Rust. Rust uses `struct` for data structures and `impl` block to define methods associated with the struct.

2. **Operator Overloading in Rust**: Rust allows operator overloading via traits. In this case, we'll implement the `Add` trait for the `point` struct to overload the `+` operator.

3. **Reading Inputs and Implementing Logic in Rust**: Utilize Rust's `std::io` module for input operations. Rust requires more explicit handling of possible failures (e.g., with `Result` types), so we'll incorporate proper error handling for input parsing.

4. **Mathematical Functions and Constants in Rust**: Rust's `f64` type includes methods for trigonometric functions (`cos`, `sin`, `atan2`). The constant `PI` is available in Rust's `std::f64::consts`.

5. **Vector Manipulation**: The manipulation of the vector `ans` will follow Rust's ownership and borrowing rules, ensuring safe memory management.

6. **Printing Output**: Use Rust's formatted printing capabilities to control the precision of the output.

### Attempt 2

**Result Summary**

- Point need copy

---

Program description:
This C++ program defines a structure `point` to represent points in 2D space, with methods for creating points, rotating them, and adding two points. It uses a constant `pi` to represent the mathematical constant Ï€ accurately. The program reads several double precision floating-point numbers from the standard input, which represent:

- The initial position of a point `(px, py)`.
- A vector `(vx, vy)` which indicates the direction.
- Dimensions `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` that define a shape.

The program then performs a series of operations to calculate and rotate points that define a custom shape based on the input dimensions and direction. This shape is initially constructed with respect to the original point and then rotated based on the angle of the vector `(vx, vy)` relative to the negative y-axis (to match the orientation of traditional mathematical coordinate systems where angles are measured from the positive x-axis). 

The key steps involve:
- Moving the initial point by a certain amount to start the shape.
- Adding points to a vector `ans` to define the vertices of the shape.
- Rotating each point around the initial point by the calculated angle.
- Outputting the final positions of the vertices with high precision.

Translation steps:
1. **Translate the `point` struct to Rust**: Rust uses `structs` to define data types, similar to C++, but initialization and method syntax differ slightly. We will define a `Point` struct with methods for creation, rotation, and an `add` function for adding points.

2. **Use `std::io` for input/output**: For reading the input, we'll use Rust's input handling via `std::io::stdin`.

3. **Vector operations**: We'll implement the custom addition operation for points as a method or using the `Add` trait in Rust.

4. **Implement the main logic**: The logic for constructing and rotating the shape will be directly translated, taking care to adapt it to Rust's syntax and idioms, like iterators for operating on the vector of points.

5. **Mathematical functions**: Rust's `f64` type has methods for trigonometric functions, similar to C++. We'll use these for the rotation calculations.

6. **Precision and formatting**: Rust's `println!` macro allows for formatting output, including setting precision for floating-point numbers.

```rust
use std::f64::consts::PI;
use std::io;
use std::ops::Add;

struct Point {
    x: f64,
    y: f64,
}

impl Point {
    fn new(x: f64, y: f64) -> Point {
        Point { x, y }
    }

    fn rotate(&mut self, angle: f64) {
        let nx = self.x * angle.cos() - self.y * angle.sin();
        let ny = self.x * angle.sin() + self.y * angle.cos();
        self.x = nx;
        self.y = ny;
    }
}

impl Add for Point {
    type Output = Point;

    fn add(self, other: Point) -> Point {
        Point::new(self.x + other.x, self.y + other.y)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("Failed to read line");
    let nums: Vec<f64> = input
        .split_whitespace()
        .map(|num| num.parse().unwrap())
        .collect();
    let (px, py, vx, vy, a, b, c, d) = (nums[0], nums[1], nums[2], nums[3], nums[4], nums[5], nums[6], nums[7]);

    let mut cur = Point::new(px, py) + Point::new(a / 2.0, 0.0);
    let mut ans = vec![cur];
    ans.push(cur + Point::new(-a / 2.0, b));
    ans.push(cur + Point::new(-a / 2.0, -b));
    ans.push(cur + Point::new((a - c) / 2.0, 0.0));
    ans.push(cur + Point::new(0.0, -d));
    ans.push(cur + Point::new(c, 0.0));
    ans.push(cur + Point::new(0.0, d));
    let tmp = ans[0];
    ans.remove(0);
    ans.push(tmp);

    let angle = vy.atan2(vx) - PI / 2.0;
    for point in &mut ans {
        *point = *point + Point::new(-px, -py);
        point.rotate(angle);
        *point = *point + Point::new(px, py);
        println!("{:.10} {:.10}", point.x, point.y);
    }
}
```

### Attempt 3

**Result Summary**

- Point copy

Program description:
This C++ program is designed to perform geometric transformations on a set of points that define a certain shape. The shape is determined by parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`, which are read from the standard input along with the initial position `(px, py)` and a direction vector `(vx, vy)`. The transformations include translation, rotation, and the definition of the initial shape using the input parameters.

1. The program defines a `point` struct with `x` and `y` coordinates, a default constructor, a parameterized constructor, and a `rotate` method that rotates the point around the origin by a given angle in radians.

2. The `operator+` is overloaded to add two points (perform vector addition).

3. The main part of the program reads the input values and creates an initial point `cur` at `(px, py)`.

4. It then creates a vector of points `ans` to store the vertices of the shape. The shape is constructed by sequentially adding points to `ans` based on the input parameters `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.

5. After constructing the shape, it adjusts the sequence of points by removing the first point and adding a temporary point stored in `tmp` at the end.

6. It calculates an angle for rotation based on the direction vector `(vx, vy)` which is perpendicular to the vector. This angle is used to rotate all points in `ans` about the origin. Before and after the rotation, translation operations are performed to align the rotation with the initial position `(px, py)`.

7. Finally, it prints out the transformed coordinates of each point in `ans` with high precision.

Translation steps:
1. **Use Rust's structured approach to I/O**: Similar to the previous translations, Rust's `std::io` module will be used for reading input and printing output.

2. **Translate the `point` struct into Rust**: The `point` struct along with its methods will be directly translated into Rust, making sure to follow Rust's conventions for naming and struct definition.

3. **Implement vector addition**: The operator overloading for adding two points will be translated into a method for Rust's `point` struct or as a standalone function.

4. **Geometric calculations and transformations**: The geometric operations, including point addition, rotation, and construction of the shape based on input parameters, will be translated into Rust. Rust's standard library provides trigonometric functions (in `std::f64::consts`) that will be used for these calculations.

5. **Rust's handling of floating-point precision and constants**: Rust strictly separates floating-point (`f32`, `f64`) and integer types. The constant `pi` will be directly used from `std::f64::consts::PI`.

6. **Mutable variable handling and vector manipulation**: Rust's ownership and borrowing rules will guide the translation of vector manipulation and mutation of variables.

### Attempt 4

**Result Summary**

- Success

Program description:
The C++ program defines a structure `point` to represent points in a 2D space with `x` and `y` coordinates and includes methods to instantiate and manipulate these points. The program calculates and displays the vertices of a transformed geometric shape based on the input parameters and the operations defined.

1. **Point Structure**: It includes constructors for initializing points and a method `rotate` to rotate a point around the origin by a given angle (in radians).

2. **Operator Overloading**: The program overloads the `+` operator for the `point` structure to support adding the coordinates of two points.

3. **Main Logic**: The program reads from `stdin` the initial position of the shape (`px`, `py`), a vector (`vx`, `vy`) representing the direction, and dimensions (`a`, `b`, `c`, `d`) that define the shape transformations. It constructs the initial shape by adding relative vectors to the current point (`cur`) to form a geometric figure. After constructing the initial shape, it rotates each vertex around the origin (shifted by `-px` and `-py` to align with the initial point) by an angle calculated from the input vector, then translates it back.

4. **Rotation Angle Calculation**: Calculates the angle to rotate the shape so that its orientation aligns with the vector direction given by (`vx`, `vy`), by using `atan2(vy, vx)` and adjusting by `-pi/2` to align it perpendicularly.

5. **Output**: For each vertex of the transformed shape, it prints the `x` and `y` coordinates with high precision.

Translation steps:
1. **Rust Struct for Point**: Define a Rust struct `Point` with `x` and `y` fields. Implement methods for creating points, adding points, and rotating points similar to the C++ version.

2. **Operator Overloading in Rust**: Implement the `Add` trait for the `Point` struct to overload the `+` operator for adding two points.

3. **Reading Input and Main Logic**: Use `std::io` to read input values. Implement the logic similar to the C++ program: calculate the shape's vertices, perform the rotation and translation, and store the results in a vector.

4. **Rotation and Translation**: Implement the rotation as a method within the `Point` struct, directly translating the mathematical operations from C++ to Rust. Ensure precision by using `f64` for floating-point operations.

5. **Printing Output**: Iterate over the vector of points, printing each point's `x` and `y` coordinates with fixed precision using the `format!` macro and `println!`.
