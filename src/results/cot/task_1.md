Program description:
This C++ program is designed to compute a specific value based on a set of strings input by the user. The main components and behaviors of the program include:

1. **Function `change`**: A utility function that toggles a specific bit in an integer `mask`. It does this by performing an XOR operation between `mask` and `1` left-shifted `bit` times. This effectively changes the state of the bit at position `bit` in `mask`.

2. **Array `h` and Map `cnt`**: An array `h` is used to store an integer representation for each input string, where each character's ASCII value is used to toggle a corresponding bit in the integer. A map `cnt` is used to count occurrences of each unique integer representation.

3. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` followed by `n` strings. For each string, it calculates an integer representation `h[i]` by toggling bits corresponding to the ASCII values of the characters in the string.

4. **Calculating `ans`**: For each string, after computing its integer representation, the program increments a counter `ans` by the count of occurrences of `h[i]` in `cnt`. It then iterates over each of the first 32 bits, toggles each bit in `h[i]`, and adds the count of occurrences of this toggled value in `cnt` to `ans`. This process counts how many strings (or their single-bit variations) have appeared before the current one.

5. **Final Output**: After processing all strings, the program outputs the value of `ans`, which represents the total number of strings that are either identical or differ by exactly one bit in their integer representations.

Translation steps:
1. **Rust Setup**: We'll use Rust's `HashMap` for counting occurrences, and Rust's standard input handling for reading values.

2. **Function `change` Translation**: This function can be directly translated to Rust, maintaining its logic.

3. **Input and Processing**: We'll read `n` and then read each string in a loop. For each string, we'll compute its integer representation and perform the counting as done in the C++ program.

4. **Rust's Ownership and Borrowing**: Rust enforces strict ownership and borrowing rules, which means we'll need to ensure we're correctly managing references, especially when interacting with the `HashMap`.

5. **Type Casting and Bit Operations**: Rust is more strict about type casting and bit operations, so we'll ensure we use the correct types and casts.

Here's the translated Rust program:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::io::{self, BufRead};

fn change(mask: i32, bit: i32) -> i32 {
    mask ^ (1 << bit)
}

fn main() {
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let mut lines = stdin.lock().lines();
    let n: usize = lines.next().unwrap().unwrap().trim().parse().unwrap();
    let mut h = vec![0; n];
    let mut cnt = HashMap::new();
    let mut ans: i64 = 0;

    for i in 0..n {
        let str = lines.next().unwrap().unwrap();
        for c in str.bytes() {
            let k = c as i32;
            h[i] = change(h[i], k);
        }
        ans += *cnt.get(&h[i]).unwrap_or(&0);
        for k in 0..32 {
            let f = change(h[i], k);
            ans += *cnt.get(&f).unwrap_or(&0);
        }
        *cnt.entry(h[i]).or_insert(0) += 1;
    }
    println!("{}", ans);
}
```
This Rust program closely follows the logic of the original C++ program, with adjustments for Rust's type system, collections, and input/output handling.

Program description:
This C++ program calculates the number of pairs of strings among the input set that have a specific property. The property in question is that two strings are considered equivalent if they have the same number of each character, or they can become equivalent by changing just one character in one of the strings.

The program uses several key concepts:

1. **Bit manipulation**: It employs a bitwise XOR operation to maintain a bitmask `h` for each string, where each bit represents the presence of a character an odd or even number of times in the string. The function `change` flips a specified bit in the mask, simulating the effect of changing a character in the string.

2. **Hashing strings into integers**: The bitmask `h` effectively hashes each string into an integer, where the same hash value implies the strings can be equivalent under the defined property.

3. **Counting valid pairs**: It uses a map `cnt` to keep track of how many strings have resulted in each unique hash value. For each string, it first adds to `ans` the count of strings already seen with the same hash (immediately equivalent). Then, for each possible character (0 to 31, assuming ASCII lowercase letters), it checks if changing that character would result in a string that has been seen before (equivalent after changing one character) and adds to `ans` accordingly.

4. **Efficiency considerations**: The program reads the number of strings `n` and then each string in a loop. For each string, it computes the hash and updates the answer `ans` based on the current string's hash and the hashes of previously seen strings.

Translation steps:
1. **I/O and basic setup in Rust**: Use Rust's I/O capabilities for reading input. Declare variables and data structures equivalent to those in the C++ program.

2. **Function `change` translation**: Directly translate the `change` function, which toggles a bit in a bitmask, to Rust.

3. **String processing and bitmask calculation**: Iterate over each character in the input strings, converting them to an integer and updating the hash (bitmask `h`) using the `change` function.

4. **Counting and hashing logic**: Implement the logic for counting valid pairs using a `HashMap` in Rust for storing counts of each hash value.

5. **Output**: Print the final answer `ans`.

Here's the translated Rust program:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::io::{self, BufRead};

fn change(mask: i32, bit: u32) -> i32 {
    mask ^ (1 << bit)
}

fn main() {
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let mut lines = stdin.lock().lines();
    let n: usize = lines.next().unwrap().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let mut h = vec![0; n];
    let mut cnt: HashMap<i32, i64> = HashMap::new();
    let mut ans: i64 = 0;

    for i in 0..n {
        let str = lines.next().unwrap().unwrap();
        for c in str.bytes() {
            let k = c as i32;
            h[i] = change(h[i], k);
        }
        ans += cnt.get(&h[i]).unwrap_or(&0);
        for k in 0..32 {
            let f = change(h[i], k);
            ans += cnt.get(&f).unwrap_or(&0);
        }
        *cnt.entry(h[i]).or_insert(0) += 1;
    }
    println!("{}", ans);
}
```

### Attempt 3

**Result Summary**

- bit shift overflow

Program description:
This C++ program calculates the number of pairs of strings within a given set of strings that, when concatenated (in any order), result in a string where each character (considering ASCII values) appears an even number of times. The program uses bitwise operations and a hash map to efficiently solve this problem.

1. **Function `change`:** It takes an integer `mask` and an integer `bit`. It flips the `bit`-th bit of `mask` using the XOR (`^`) operation and returns the new value. This function is used to keep track of character counts in a compact bitwise form.

2. **Array `h`:** An array that stores a hash value for each string. This hash value represents which characters (by their ASCII value) appear an odd number of times in the string. The `h` array is indexed by string indices, from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Map `cnt`:** A map that counts how many strings have a given hash value.

4. **Variable `ans`:** A long long integer that accumulates the total number of valid string pairs.

5. **Main logic:**
   - The program reads an integer `n` and then iterates `n` times to read `n` strings.
   - For each string, it calculates its hash value `h[i]` by iterating over each character, converting it to an integer `k`, and calling `change(h[i], k)`. This effectively counts how many times each character appears in the string, modulo 2.
   - It then increments `ans` by `cnt[h[i]]`, which represents the number of strings seen so far that, when concatenated with the current string, would have an even number of each character.
   - It also checks, for each possible character (0 to 31, assuming ASCII characters), whether flipping the count of that character would result in a string that, when concatenated with strings having the resulting hash, would have an even number of each character. This is done by calling `change(h[i], k)` for each `k` and incrementing `ans` by `cnt[f]` where `f` is the flipped hash.
   - Finally, it increments `cnt[h[i]]` to include the current string in the count of strings with hash `h[i]`.

Translation steps:
1. **Rust environment setup and input operations**: Use `std::io` for input and output operations, and `std::collections::HashMap` instead of `std::map`.

2. **Implement `change` function**: The exact logic can be used, considering Rust's type system and function definition syntax.

3. **Replace the array `h` with a vector**: Rust uses vectors for dynamic arrays.

4. **Use `HashMap` for `cnt`**: This directly translates to Rust's `HashMap` for counting occurrences of hash values.

5. **Main logic translation**: The overall structure will remain the same, with adjustments for Rust's syntax and idioms, such as iterators for looping through characters of a string and tuple unpacking for iterating with index.

Here is the translated Rust program:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::io;

fn change(mask: i32, bit: i32) -> i32 {
    mask ^ (1 << bit)
}

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();
    let n: usize = input.trim().parse().unwrap();
    let mut h = vec![0; n];
    let mut cnt: HashMap<i32, i64> = HashMap::new();
    let mut ans: i64 = 0;

    for i in 0..n {
        input.clear();
        io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).unwrap();
        for c in input.trim().chars() {
            let k = c as i32;
            h[i] = change(h[i], k);
        }
        ans += *cnt.get(&h[i]).unwrap_or(&0);
        for k in 0..32 {
            let f = change(h[i], k);
            ans += *cnt.get(&f).unwrap_or(&0);
        }
        *cnt.entry(h[i]).or_insert(0) += 1;
    }
    println!("{}", ans);
}
```

**Result Summary**

- bit shift overflow

Program description:
This C++ program is designed to compute a particular statistic based on a sequence of input strings. The core concepts involved in this program include bit manipulation, hashing, and efficient counting using a map. Here is a detailed breakdown of its functionalities:

1. **Bit Manipulation**: The function `change` takes a bitmask `mask` and a bit position `bit` and toggles the bit at position `bit` in `mask`. This is achieved through the XOR operation `mask ^ (1 << bit)`, which flips the specified bit.

2. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n`, followed by `n` strings. For each string, it computes a hash value `h[i]` by iterating over each character in the string, converting the character to its integer ASCII value, and toggling the corresponding bit in `h[i]`. This hashing scheme effectively counts the parity (odd or even) of the occurrence of each ASCII character's bit positions in the input string.

3. **Counting and Answer Calculation**: The program uses a map `cnt` to keep track of the occurrences of each unique hash value computed from the input strings. For each string, it increases the answer `ans` by the count of strings seen so far that have either the same hash value or a hash value that differs in exactly one bit position. This is done by first adding the count of the current hash value and then iterating over all bit positions from 0 to 31, toggling each bit and adding the counts of the resulting hash values.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total count `ans`, which represents the number of pairs of strings that are either identical in their hash value or differ by exactly one bit in their hash value.

Translation steps:
1. **Rust Setup and Input**: Use Rust's `std::io` module to read input. Rust provides more safety and control over input operations compared to C++'s `cin`.

2. **Function `change` Translation**: Implement the `change` function in Rust, which will operate similarly to its C++ counterpart, toggling a specific bit in a bitmask.

3. **Data Structures for Counting**: Use Rust's `std::collections::HashMap` for the `cnt` map to count occurrences of each hash value.

4. **Hash Computation**: Iterate over each character of the input strings, converting each character to its ASCII value, and use the `change` function to compute the hash value `h[i]` for each string.

5. **Answer Calculation**: Iterate over each input string and its computed hash value, update the answer `ans` by adding the counts of strings with the same or one bit different hash values, and update the counts in `cnt`.

6. **Output**: Print the final answer using `println!`.

Here's the translated Rust code:

```rust
use std::collections::HashMap;
use std::io::{self, BufRead};

fn change(mask: i32, bit: i32) -> i32 {
    mask ^ (1 << bit)
}

fn main() {
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let mut lines = stdin.lock().lines();
    let n: usize = lines.next().unwrap().unwrap().trim().parse().unwrap();
    let mut h = vec![0; n];
    let mut cnt: HashMap<i32, i64> = HashMap::new();
    let mut ans: i64 = 0;

    for i in 0..n {
        let str = lines.next().unwrap().unwrap();
        for c in str.bytes() {
            let k = c as i32;
            h[i] = change(h[i], k);
        }
        ans += *cnt.get(&h[i]).unwrap_or(&0);
        for k in 0..32 {
            let f = change(h[i], k);
            ans += *cnt.get(&f).unwrap_or(&0);
        }
        *cnt.entry(h[i]).or_insert(0) += 1;
    }
    println!("{}", ans);
}
```
This Rust code closely follows the logic of the original C++ program, applying Rust's language-specific features and idioms for safety and efficiency.
