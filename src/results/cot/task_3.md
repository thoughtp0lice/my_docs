Program description:
This C++ program is an advanced example that implements a segment tree for efficient range updates and queries. The context or specific application of this segment tree is not explicitly stated, but the operations and structure suggest it's designed to manage intervals or segments with specific properties, such as enabling or disabling certain indices based on a set of rules or conditions. Here are the primary components and behaviors of the program:

1. **Global Variables**:
   - `N`: A constant representing the maximum size of the array `a` and `c`. It is set to `2^20`.
   - `n`, `m`: Integers to store the number of elements and the number of operations, respectively.
   - `a[]`: An array to store elements.
   - `c[]`: An auxiliary array used in conjunction with the segment tree.
   - `tag[]`, `cnt[]`: Arrays representing the segment tree. `tag` is used to mark nodes for lazy propagation (to avoid immediate updates), and `cnt` keeps track of the count of certain conditions within segments.

2. **Segment Tree Operations**:
   - `update`: Updates the count at a node based on its children's counts and the tag value.
   - `modify`: Recursively applies updates to ranges and handles lazy propagation.
   - `settle`, `init`, `ins`: Auxiliary functions to adjust and initialize the segment tree based on specific conditions and inputs.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The program reads `n` and `m`, initializes the segment tree with input values, and then performs `m` operations based on additional input. Each operation involves adjusting the segment tree to reflect the changes (insertions or modifications) and then querying the segment tree to output the count of a specific condition (represented by `cnt[1]`, the root of the segment tree).

Translation steps:
1. **Rust doesn't support global mutable state in the same way as C++**: We will encapsulate the segment tree and its operations within a struct to manage state in a safe, idiomatic way.

2. **Use `Vec` instead of static arrays**: Rust prefers dynamic arrays (`Vec`) over static-sized arrays for flexibility and safety. We'll define the segment tree, `tag`, `cnt`, and auxiliary arrays as `Vec`s.

3. **Function Definitions**: Methods in Rust will be defined within the context of the struct, taking `&mut self` to mutate internal state.

4. **Rust's Safety and Ownership**: We'll ensure that all accesses and mutations follow Rust's strict ownership and borrowing rules to avoid unsafe behavior.

5. **Input and Output**: Rust uses `std::io` for input and output. We'll use buffered reading for efficient input handling and `println!` for output.

6. **No implicit type conversions**: Rust requires explicit type conversions. We'll explicitly handle any necessary conversions between types (e.g., from usize to i32).

7. **Error Handling**: We'll handle potential errors more explicitly, particularly when reading input and parsing numbers.

---

Translating the given C++ program directly to Rust while adhering to its idiomatic practices results in a significantly different structure due to Rust's ownership model, lack of global mutable state, and explicit error handling. Given the complexity and the specific data structures involved (like segment trees with lazy propagation), the translation is not straightforward and involves redesigning certain aspects to fit Rust's paradigms. Below is a Rust program that attempts to replicate the functionality of the original C++ code, encapsulating the segment tree logic within a struct:

```rust
use std::io::{self, BufRead};

const N: usize = 1 << 20;

struct SegmentTree {
    tag: Vec<i32>,
    cnt: Vec<i32>,
    c: Vec<i32>,
}

impl SegmentTree {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            tag: vec![0; N << 2],
            cnt: vec![0; N << 2],
            c: vec![0; N],
        }
    }

    fn update(&mut self, p: usize, l: usize, r: usize) {
        if l == r {
            self.cnt[p] = if self.c[l] != 0 { 1 } else { 0 } * if self.tag[p] == 0 { 1 } else { 0 };
        } else {
            self.cnt[p] = (self.cnt[p << 1] + self.cnt[p << 1 | 1]) * if self.tag[p] == 0 { 1 } else { 0 };
        }
    }

    fn modify(&mut self, p: usize, l: usize, r: usize, left: usize, right: usize, x: i32) {
        if l == left && r == right {
            self.tag[p] += x;
            self.update(p, l, r);
            return;
        }
        let mid = (l + r) >> 1;
        if right <= mid {
            self.modify(p << 1, l, mid, left, right, x);
        } else if left > mid {
            self.modify(p << 1 | 1, mid + 1, r, left, right, x);
        } else {
            self.modify(p << 1, l, mid, left, mid, x);
            self.modify(p << 1 | 1, mid + 1, r, mid + 1, right, x);
        }
        self.update(p, l, r);
    }

    fn settle(&mut self, x: usize, w: i32, a: &Vec<usize>) {
        if a[x] > a[x - 1] {
            self.modify(1, 1, N, a[x - 1] + 1, a[x], w);
        }
    }

    fn init(&mut self, x: usize, w: i32, a: &Vec<usize>) {
        self.settle(x, w, a);
        if x + 1 < a.len() {
            self.settle(x + 1, w, a);
        }
    }

    fn ins(&mut self, x: usize, w: i32) {
        self.c[x] += w;
        self.modify(1, 1, N, x, x, 0);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let mut lines = stdin.lock().lines();
    let first_line = lines.next().unwrap().unwrap();
    let mut parts = first_line.split_whitespace();
    let n: usize = parts.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let m: usize = parts.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();

    let mut a = vec![N; n + 1];
    let mut st = SegmentTree::new();

    for i in 1..=n {
        let num: usize = lines.next().unwrap().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
        a[i] = num;
        st.ins(a[i], 1);
        st.settle(i, 1, &a);
    }

    for _ in 0..m {
        let line = lines.next().unwrap().unwrap();
        let mut parts = line.split_whitespace();
        let x: usize = parts.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
        let y: usize = parts.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();

        st.init(x, -1, &a);
        st.ins(a[x], -1);
        a[x] = y;
        st.ins(a[x], 1);
        st.init(x, 1, &a);

        println!("{}", st.cnt[1]);
    }
}
```

This Rust code encapsulates the segment tree's functionality within a `SegmentTree` struct and adheres to Rust's safety and ownership rules. It also includes error handling for input operations. Please note that this translation attempts to closely replicate the logic and structure of the original C++ program, but some adaptations were necessary to fit Rust's idiomatic practices.

### Attempt 2

**Result Summary**

- (IO stuff)
- Compiles
- Does not pass test case

Program description:
This C++ program is an implementation of a segment tree with lazy propagation, designed to efficiently manage interval updates and queries in a large array. The program is set up to handle a specific problem involving intervals and point updates. Here's a breakdown of its components and functionality:

1. **Global Variables**:
   - `N`: The maximum size of the array, defined as `1 << 20` (2^20).
   - `n`, `m`: Integers to store the number of elements in the array and the number of operations, respectively.
   - `a[]`: The array of elements.
   - `c[]`: An auxiliary array used for tracking certain values at points.
   - `tag[]`: A segment tree array used for lazy propagation, to mark intervals that have pending updates.
   - `cnt[]`: A segment tree array used for storing the count of certain conditions across segments.

2. **Functions**:
   - `update(int p, int l, int r)`: Updates the `cnt` array based on the current state of `c[]` and `tag[]` for a given segment.
   - `modify(int p, int L, int R, int l, int r, int x)`: Recursively applies updates to segments and ensures that these updates are propagated lazily.
   - `settle(int x, int w)`: Adjusts the segment tree based on changes in the `a[]` array at position `x` with weight `w`.
   - `init(int x, int w)`: Initializes or updates the state of the segment tree related to the element at position `x` with weight `w`.
   - `ins(int x, int w)`: Updates the count `c[]` at position `x` and modifies the segment tree accordingly.

3. **Main Logic**:
   - The main function begins by reading `n` and `m`, the size of the array and the number of operations.
   - It initializes the array `a[]` by reading values and setting up the segment tree with the `settle` and `ins` functions.
   - For each operation, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, applies modifications to the segment tree to reflect the updates, and prints the current value of `cnt[1]`, which represents a global property maintained by the segment tree.

Translation steps:
1. **Rust Environment Setup**: Set up the environment to read input and write output. Use Rust's I/O facilities for this purpose.
2. **Data Structures**: Translate the arrays and variables to Rust, considering Rust's ownership and borrowing rules. Rust doesn't support global variables in the same way as C++, so we may encapsulate the logic in a struct.
3. **Translation of Functions**: Translate the functions to Rust, ensuring type safety and following Rust’s conventions for error handling. In Rust, it's common to return results from functions instead of modifying external or global state.
4. **Segment Tree Logic**: The core logic for the segment tree, including lazy propagation, remains the same, but it will be adapted to Rust's syntax and idioms. Instead of direct array manipulation, use Rust's vector operations.
5. **Main Logic Translation**: Translate the main logic to Rust, adhering to Rust's way of handling input and output and its stricter error handling.

This translation involves careful consideration of Rust's memory safety guarantees, error handling, and its different approach to global state.

---

Given the complexity and the specific requirements for a complete, compilable Rust program that mirrors the provided C++ code's functionality, including a segment tree with lazy propagation, here is a comprehensive Rust translation. 

This translation involves creating a struct to encapsulate the segment tree logic, as Rust doesn't handle global state in the same way C++ does, and adapting the logic to Rust's ownership and type system.

```rust
use std::io::{self, BufRead};

struct SegmentTree {
    cnt: Vec<i32>,
    tag: Vec<i32>,
    c: Vec<i32>,
}

impl SegmentTree {
    fn new(size: usize) -> Self {
        Self {
            cnt: vec![0; size * 4],
            tag: vec![0; size * 4],
            c: vec![0; size],
        }
    }

    fn update(&mut self, p: usize, l: usize, r: usize) {
        if l == r {
            self.cnt[p] = if self.c[l] > 0 && self.tag[p] == 0 { 1 } else { 0 };
        } else {
            self.cnt[p] = if self.tag[p] == 0 { self.cnt[p * 2] + self.cnt[p * 2 + 1] } else { 0 };
        }
    }

    fn modify(&mut self, p: usize, l: usize, r: usize, left: usize, right: usize, x: i32) {
        if left <= l && r <= right {
            self.tag[p] += x;
            self.update(p, l, r);
            return;
        }
        let mid = (l + r) / 2;
        if left <= mid {
            self.modify(p * 2, l, mid, left, right, x);
        }
        if right > mid {
            self.modify(p * 2 + 1, mid + 1, r, left, right, x);
        }
        self.update(p, l, r);
    }

    fn ins(&mut self, x: usize, w: i32, n: usize) {
        self.c[x] += w;
        self.modify(1, 1, n, x, x, 0);
    }

    fn settle(&mut self, x: usize, w: i32, a: &Vec<usize>, n: usize) {
        if a[x] > a[x - 1] {
            self.modify(1, 1, n, a[x - 1] + 1, a[x], w);
        }
    }
}

fn main() {
    let stdin = io::stdin();
    let mut lines = stdin.lock().lines();
    let first_line = lines.next().unwrap().unwrap();
    let mut iter = first_line.split_whitespace();
    let n: usize = iter.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let m: usize = iter.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();

    let mut a: Vec<usize> = vec![0; n + 1];
    let mut st = SegmentTree::new(1 << 20);

    for i in 1..=n {
        let x: usize = lines.next().unwrap().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
        a[i] = x;
        st.ins(x, 1, 1 << 20);
        st.settle(i, 1, &a, 1 << 20);
    }

    for _ in 0..m {
        let line = lines.next().unwrap().unwrap();
        let mut iter = line.split_whitespace();
        let x: usize = iter.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
        let y: usize = iter.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();

        st.settle(x, -1, &a, 1 << 20);
        st.ins(a[x], -1, 1 << 20);
        a[x] = y;
        st.ins(y, 1, 1 << 20);
        st.settle(x, 1, &a, 1 << 20);
        println!("{}", st.cnt[1]);
    }
}
```

This Rust program closely follows the structure and logic of the original C++ code, adapted to Rust's syntax and semantics. It includes a `SegmentTree` struct to encapsulate the segment tree's data and operations, replacing the global arrays and functions in the C++ version. The `main` function processes input and coordinates the operations on the segment tree, similar to the C++ version.

Please note, given the complexity of the original C++ code and the translation effort required to ensure it faithfully mirrors the logic in Rust, further testing and adjustments may be necessary to ensure it handles all edge cases as expected.

### Attempt 3

**Results summary**

- Correct outside of io

---

Program description:
This C++ program is an implementation of a segment tree with lazy propagation, designed to efficiently handle range updates and queries on an array. It's used in scenarios that involve modifying ranges of elements and querying aggregate information about segments of the array. This specific implementation counts the number of non-zero elements in a range that aren't marked by a "tag".

Key components and operations in the program:
- **Arrays**: `a`, `c`, `tag`, `cnt` serve different purposes.
  - `a` stores input values.
  - `c` tracks counts of values at specific indices.
  - `tag` is used for lazy propagation to mark nodes that have pending updates.
  - `cnt` stores the count of non-zero elements that aren't marked by a tag in a segment.
- **Segment Tree**: Implemented using the `tag` and `cnt` arrays. The tree supports range updates (modifications) and efficient queries.
- **Functions**:
  - `update`: Updates the `cnt` array based on the `c` array and `tag` values.
  - `modify`: Applies updates (modifications) to a range, and uses lazy propagation to mark nodes with pending updates.
  - `settle`: Adjusts the segment tree based on changes in the `a` array.
  - `init`: Initializes or updates the segment tree when the value at an index changes.
  - `ins`: Updates the count of a specific value and modifies the segment tree accordingly.

The `main` function reads `n` and `m`, initializes the segment tree with values from the `a` array, and processes `m` updates. Each update involves changing a value in the `a` array and recalculating the count of non-zero, unmarked elements in the entire range, which is then printed.

Translation steps:
1. **Translating the data structures**: Rust does not support static-sized arrays with sizes determined at runtime or very large sizes on the stack. We will use `Vec<i32>` for dynamic arrays.
2. **Function translation**: The recursive functions `update`, `modify`, `settle`, `init`, and `ins` will be translated directly, keeping their logic intact.
3. **Handling Input/Output**: Use `std::io` for reading input and printing output.
4. **Global Variables**: Rust discourages the use of global mutable state. We will encapsulate the global state within a struct and pass it around as needed.
5. **Lazy Propagation and Segment Tree Logic**: Maintain the logic for lazy propagation and segment updates. Rust's ownership and borrowing rules will ensure memory safety without manual memory management.
6. **Error Handling**: Use `.expect()` for simple error handling when reading input.
7. **Indexing**: Rust uses zero-based indexing, adjust calculations and accesses accordingly. However, since this program operates on a 1-based index convention for the algorithm's logic, we'll need to carefully adjust array sizes and accesses.

---

Given the complexity and specific requirements of the original C++ program, translating it into Rust while maintaining the exact behavior, especially considering the usage of segment trees with lazy propagation, requires careful handling of Rust's ownership and indexing rules. Below is a complete Rust translation that attempts to closely replicate the logic and functionality of the C++ program:

```rust
use std::io::{self, BufRead};

const N: usize = 1 << 20;

struct SegmentTree {
    cnt: Vec<i32>,
    tag: Vec<i32>,
}

impl SegmentTree {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            cnt: vec![0; N << 2],
            tag: vec![0; N << 2],
        }
    }

    fn update(&mut self, p: usize, l: usize, r: usize, c: &Vec<i32>) {
        if l == r {
            self.cnt[p] = if c[l] > 0 && self.tag[p] == 0 { 1 } else { 0 };
        } else {
            self.cnt[p] = (self.cnt[p << 1] + self.cnt[p << 1 | 1]) * if self.tag[p] == 0 { 1 } else { 0 };
        }
    }

    fn modify(&mut self, p: usize, l: usize, r: usize, ql: usize, qr: usize, x: i32, c: &mut Vec<i32>) {
        if ql <= l && r <= qr {
            self.tag[p] += x;
            self.update(p, l, r, c);
            return;
        }
        let mid = (l + r) >> 1;
        if ql <= mid {
            self.modify(p << 1, l, mid, ql, qr.min(mid), x, c);
        }
        if qr > mid {
            self.modify(p << 1 | 1, mid + 1, r, (mid + 1).max(ql), qr, x, c);
        }
        self.update(p, l, r, c);
    }
}

fn settle(a: &Vec<i32>, x: usize, w: i32, tree: &mut SegmentTree, c: &mut Vec<i32>) {
    if a[x] > a[x - 1] {
        tree.modify(1, 1, N, (a[x - 1] + 1) as usize, a[x] as usize, w, c);
    }
}

fn init(a: &Vec<i32>, x: usize, w: i32, tree: &mut SegmentTree, c: &mut Vec<i32>) {
    settle(a, x, w, tree, c);
    if x + 1 < a.len() {
        settle(a, x + 1, w, tree, c);
    }
}

fn ins(x: usize, w: i32, tree: &mut SegmentTree, c: &mut Vec<i32>) {
    c[x] += w;
    tree.modify(1, 1, N, x, x, 0, c);
}

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("Failed to read line");
    let nums: Vec<usize> = input
        .split_whitespace()
        .map(|x| x.parse().unwrap())
        .collect();
    let (n, m) = (nums[0], nums[1]);

    let mut a = vec![N as i32; n + 1];
    let mut c = vec![0; N + 1];
    let mut tree = SegmentTree::new();

    for i in 1..=n {
        input.clear();
        io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("Failed to read line");
        a[i] = input.trim().parse().unwrap();
        ins(a[i] as usize, 1, &mut tree, &mut c);
        settle(&a, i, 1, &mut tree, &mut c);
    }

    for _ in 0..m {
        input.clear();
        io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("Failed to read line");
        let nums: Vec<usize> = input
            .split_whitespace()
            .map(|x| x.parse().unwrap())
            .collect();
        let (x, y) = (nums[0], nums[1]);

        init(&a, x, -1, &mut tree, &mut c);
        ins(a[x] as usize, -1, &mut tree, &mut c);
        a[x] = y as i32;
        ins(a[x] as usize, 1, &mut tree, &mut c);
        init(&a, x, 1, &mut tree, &mut c);
        println!("{}", tree.cnt[1]);
    }
}
```

This translation maintains the logic and structure of the original C++ program while adapting it to Rust's syntax and idioms. The code initializes a segment tree to track counts of non-zero elements that aren't marked and handles modifications and queries based on the input operations. Note, due to the complexity and the specific optimizations in the original C++ code, this Rust version focuses on faithfully replicating the algorithm and its behavior within Rust's safety and type system.

### Attempt 4

**Result summary**
 
- Compiled but not pass test case

---

Program description:
This C++ program implements a segment tree to efficiently perform range updates and queries in a dynamic context. It's designed to manage intervals and counts within a large array, supporting complex operations like insertion, deletion, and modification with relatively low time complexity. Here's a breakdown of its components and functionality:

1. **Constants and Global Variables**: 
   - `N`: The size of the array, set to `1 << 20` (2^20), indicating a large array capable of holding over a million elements.
   - `n`, `m`: Variables to store the number of elements in the array and the number of operations to perform, respectively.
   - `a[]`: An array to store the elements.
   - `c[]`: An array used for counting purposes.
   - `tag[]`, `cnt[]`: Arrays used by the segment tree. `tag[]` is used for lazy propagation to mark nodes that need updates, and `cnt[]` is used to store counts of elements or intervals meeting certain criteria.

2. **Segment Tree Operations**:
   - `update`: A function to update the count of a node in the segment tree based on its children or its own value.
   - `modify`: A recursive function to apply updates to a range within the segment tree. It handles range updates efficiently using lazy propagation.
   
3. **Utility Functions**:
   - `settle`: Adjusts the segment tree when the value of an element changes in a way that affects intervals.
   - `init`: Initializes or updates the segment tree for a particular element and its neighbor.
   - `ins`: Inserts or deletes elements from the counting array and updates the segment tree accordingly.

4. **Main Logic**:
   - Reads the number of elements (`n`) and operations (`m`), initializes the array `a` and the segment tree with initial values.
   - For each operation, it reads two integers `x` and `y`, representing an operation to update the `x`-th element to `y`. It performs necessary updates on the segment tree and prints the current count of the root node, which reflects a global property of the array after the update.

Translation steps:
1. **Adapt Global Variables and Constants**: Rust discourages the use of global mutable state. We'll define a struct to encapsulate the segment tree's data and operations.
   
2. **Implement the Segment Tree**: Translate the segment tree operations (`update`, `modify`, `settle`, `init`, `ins`) as methods of the struct, taking care to adjust for Rust's ownership and borrowing rules.

3. **Input/Output**: Use `std::io` for reading input and printing output. Rust requires explicit error handling for I/O operations, so we'll use `.expect()` for simplicity in handling potential I/O errors.

4. **Main Functionality**: Translate the main logic, keeping the program's structure but adapting it to Rust's syntax and best practices, including iteration and manipulation of vectors.

5. **Error Handling**: When parsing integers from strings, handle potential parsing errors appropriately. For simplicity, `.expect()` can be used, but real-world applications should use more robust error handling.

6. **Language Specifics**: Adjust for differences between C++ and Rust, such as indexing (Rust indices start at 0, not 1) and integer division.

Translating the provided C++ program to Rust while preserving its complex logic involving segment trees, lazy propagation, and dynamic updates is intricate due to Rust's ownership rules, lack of global variables, and different standard library. Below is a carefully constructed Rust program that implements the described functionality. However, given the complexity of the original C++ program, please note that the Rust version also becomes quite detailed to accurately manage memory safety and mutability in a way that Rust enforces.

```rust
use std::io::{self, BufRead};

struct SegTree {
    cnt: Vec<i32>,
    tag: Vec<i32>,
}

impl SegTree {
    fn new(size: usize) -> Self {
        SegTree {
            cnt: vec![0; size << 2],
            tag: vec![0; size << 2],
        }
    }

    fn update(&mut self, p: usize, l: usize, r: usize, c: &Vec<i32>) {
        if l == r {
            self.cnt[p] = if c[l] > 0 && self.tag[p] == 0 { 1 } else { 0 };
        } else {
            self.cnt[p] = if self.tag[p] == 0 {
                self.cnt[p << 1] + self.cnt[p << 1 | 1]
            } else {
                0
            };
        }
    }

    fn modify(&mut self, p: usize, l: usize, r: usize, start: usize, end: usize, x: i32, c: &mut Vec<i32>) {
        if start <= l && r <= end {
            self.tag[p] += x;
            self.update(p, l, r, c);
            return;
        }
        let mid = (l + r) >> 1;
        if start <= mid {
            self.modify(p << 1, l, mid, start, end, x, c);
        }
        if mid < end {
            self.modify(p << 1 | 1, mid + 1, r, start, end, x, c);
        }
        self.update(p, l, r, c);
    }

    fn settle(&mut self, x: usize, a: &Vec<i32>, c: &mut Vec<i32>, n: usize, w: i32) {
        if a[x] > a[x - 1] {
            self.modify(1, 1, n, (a[x - 1] + 1) as usize, a[x] as usize, w, c);
        }
    }

    fn ins(&mut self, x: usize, w: i32, c: &mut Vec<i32>) {
        c[x] += w;
        self.modify(1, 1, N, x, x, 0, c);
    }
}

const N: usize = 1 << 20;

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("Failed to read line");
    let mut parts = input.trim().split_whitespace();
    let n: usize = parts.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let m: usize = parts.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();

    let mut a = vec![0; n + 1];
    let mut c = vec![0; N + 1];
    let mut seg_tree = SegTree::new(N);

    for i in 1..=n {
        let mut input = String::new();
        io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("Failed to read line");
        a[i] = input.trim().parse().unwrap();
        seg_tree.ins(a[i] as usize, 1, &mut c);
        seg_tree.settle(i, &a, &mut c, N, 1);
    }

    for _ in 0..m {
        let mut input = String::new();
        io::stdin().read_line(&mut input).expect("Failed to read line");
        let mut parts = input.trim().split_whitespace();
        let x: usize = parts.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
        let y: i32 = parts.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();

        seg_tree.settle(x, &a, &mut c, N, -1);
        seg_tree.ins(a[x] as usize, -1, &mut c);
        a[x] = y;
        seg_tree.ins(a[x] as usize, 1, &mut c);
        seg_tree.settle(x, &a, &mut c, N, 1);

        println!("{}", seg_tree.cnt[1]);
    }
}
```

This Rust translation encapsulates the segment tree's functionality within a `SegTree` struct to manage its state safely, following Rust's ownership and borrowing rules. It translates the logic of range updates, lazy propagation, and dynamic array manipulation from the original C++ program into Rust, adapting to Rust's stricter type system and memory safety guarantees. The program reads input, modifies the segment tree according to the operations described, and prints out the result after each modification, similar to the original C++ logic.
