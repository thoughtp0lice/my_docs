# CFG translation

Currently LLM is not following the graph at all. I believe it’s LLM will rely more on the easer to parse source C++ code than the harder to understand CFG.  LLM should be capable of understanding the CFG since when I tried (2-3 times) to only feed LLM the CFG and ask LLM to generate code from it, it’s capable of following the CFG exactly.
