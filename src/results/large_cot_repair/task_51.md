#### assistant

Program description:
The provided C++ program implements a dynamic programming solution to calculate and print the maximum number of birds that can be summoned given specific constraints and costs associated with summoning birds from different nests. The program uses a 2D array `dp` to store the highest amount of mana available after summoning a certain number of birds from a given number of nests, with the following inputs:

- `n`: The number of nests.
- `W`: The initial points of mana.
- `B`: The points by which the mana capacity increases after a bird is summoned.
- `X`: The points restored when moving from one tree to the next.
- `c[]`: An array where `c[i]` represents the number of birds in the `i`-th nest.
- `cost[]`: An array where `cost[i]` is the mana cost to summon a bird from the `i`-th nest.

The program initializes the `dp` array with `-1` to indicate that a state is unreachable by default, then sets `dp[0][0] = W` to denote that starting with the initial mana and no birds summoned is a valid state. It iterates through each nest (`i`) and each possible number of summoned birds (`j`) to calculate the maximum mana that can be retained while summoning `j` birds after visiting `i` nests, taking into account the mana cost of summoning birds and the increase in mana capacity.

For each state `(i, j)`, it calculates the possible new mana value (`new_m`) after summoning a certain number (`k`) of birds from the `i`-th nest and compares it with the maximum mana (`max_m`) possible for that state. If summoning birds leads to a mana value that is non-negative and higher than the current value stored in `dp[i][j]`, it updates `dp[i][j]` with the new value. The variable `ans` keeps track of the maximum number of birds that can be summoned based on the states explored.

Translation steps:
1. **Use Rust's handling for input/output**: Rust provides `std::io` for input/output operations, ensuring proper error handling when reading from stdin and writing to stdout.
2. **Mimic the 2D dynamic programming array**: Rust does not have built-in support for fixed-size arrays with sizes determined at runtime, so we'll use `Vec` to create a dynamic 2D array equivalent to `dp`.
3. **Initialize `dp` with `-1`**: We'll initialize the Rust equivalent of the `dp` array with `-1` using iterative loops or vector operations.
4. **Implement the dynamic programming logic**: Translating the nested loops directly, adjusting for Rust's zero-based indexing and handling Rust's type system correctly.
5. **Avoid global variables**: Pass `n`, `W`, `B`, and `X` as function parameters instead of using global variables.
6. **Error handling for input parsing**: Use Rust's `unwrap` or error handling mechanisms to safely convert input strings to integers.
7. **Memory management**: Ensure that the Rust version does not exceed memory limits by avoiding unnecessary copies of large data structures.

Actual Output: 


timeout


#### assistant

Error Explanation:
The provided Rust solution may lead to a timeout error due to its computational complexity, especially given the size constraints of the input data. The algorithm iterates through all nests and for each nest, it iterates through a range of possible numbers of summoned birds (`j` in the range `0..10010`), and for each of those, it might iterate up to `c[i]` times. This results in a large number of iterations, potentially leading to performance issues or a timeout with large input sizes.

The primary cause of the timeout is the inefficient handling of iterations and possibly recalculating the same state multiple times without effectively pruning impossible or redundant states.

Repair Plan:
To address the timeout issue without changing the fundamental logic of the algorithm (since the task's complexity and expected solution approach are not specified beyond the provided algorithm), we should focus on optimizing the implementation in terms of reducing unnecessary computations and optimizing iteration ranges. However, given Rust's performance and the algorithm's complexity, if the logic accurately reflects the problem's requirements and there's no straightforward optimization available that doesn't alter the algorithm's core approach, we might be hitting practical limits of the algorithm's efficiency with the given constraints.

1. **Optimizing iteration bounds**: Analyze the loops to reduce the range of iterations where possible, avoiding unnecessary computations especially in the innermost loops.

2. **Memoization**: Ensure that computed states are reused effectively, preventing redundant calculations. This might not be directly applicable if states are already being maximally reused in the given logic.

3. **Parallel computation**: Consider leveraging Rust's concurrency features to parallelize independent computations, though this might not be directly applicable without significantly rethinking the algorithm's structure.

4. **Algorithmic improvement**: Reevaluate the problem-solving approach for potential algorithmic optimizations or alternative strategies that could lead to significant reductions in computational complexity. This might involve a different way to represent or progress through the problem state space.

Given the nature of the described issue and without a clear path to a specific optimization that would guarantee resolving the timeout within the constraints of the provided algorithm, a complete rewrite or substantial modification beyond minor adjustments or optimizations may be necessary for a solution that meets the performance expectations.

Given the complexity and the nature of the original program and the limitations around dynamically optimizing it for the timeout issue without changing the core algorithm, I'll provide a theoretical approach to address performance concerns based on the error explanation and repair plan. However, it's important to note that without a significant algorithmic improvement or simplification, addressing a timeout issue in a computationally intensive task can be challenging.

If the task is hitting timeout issues due to its computational complexity, and given the constraints of the problem (without altering the core logic of the algorithm provided), a direct or simple fix might not be possible. In real-world scenarios, this typically indicates the need for re-evaluating the algorithmic approach or employing more advanced optimizations that might not be straightforward to implement or might require substantial changes to the code structure.

However, based on the repair plan, here's an attempt to provide a more efficient version of the original Rust code by optimizing iteration bounds. Note that without fundamentally changing the algorithm to a more efficient one, we can't guarantee overcoming timeout issues for all possible inputs within the given problem constraints.

```rust
use std::io::{self, Read};
use std::cmp::{min, max};

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_to_string(&mut input).unwrap();
    let mut iter = input.split_whitespace();
    let n: usize = iter.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let w: i64 = iter.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let b: i64 = iter.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let x: i64 = iter.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();

    let c: Vec<i64> = (0..n).map(|_| iter.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap()).collect();
    let cost: Vec<i64> = (0..n).map(|_| iter.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap()).collect();

    let mut dp = vec![vec![-1i64; 10010]; n + 1];
    dp[0][0] = w;
    let mut ans = 0;

    for i in 1..=n {
        for j in 0..10010 {
            if dp[i - 1][j] == -1 {
                continue;
            }
            for k in 0..=min(j as i64, c[i - 1]) {
                let new_m = min(w + j as i64 * b, dp[i - 1][j] + x) - k * cost[i - 1];
                if new_m >= 0 {
                    dp[i][j + k as usize] = max(dp[i][j + k as usize], new_m);
                    ans = max(ans, j + k as usize);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    println!("{}", ans);
}
```

This code attempts to maintain the logic of your original C++ program while making the translation to Rust with optimizations. However, without a deeper algorithmic improvement focusing on reducing the computational complexity or changing how states are calculated and stored, it might still face challenges with input sets that lead to high computational demands.

#### assistant

Program description:
The provided C++ program is a dynamic programming solution to a problem related to summoning birds from nests with certain constraints on mana points. The program reads four integers `n`, `W`, `B`, `X`, representing the number of trees (or nests), initial mana points, the increase in mana capacity per bird summoned, and the mana restored when moving to the next tree, respectively. It then reads two arrays, `c` and `cost`, where `c[i]` represents the number of birds in the i-th nest, and `cost[i]` represents the mana cost to summon a bird from the i-th nest.

The program uses a 2D dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum mana points available after considering `i` nests and summoning `j` birds in total. It initializes `dp` with `-1` to indicate unvisited states and sets `dp[0][0]` to `W`, indicating the initial state with `W` mana points and no birds summoned.

The main logic iterates over each nest and each possible total number of birds summoned up to that point, trying to summon from 0 up to `min(j, c[i])` birds from the current nest (`i`). It calculates the new mana points after summoning `k` birds from the current nest and updates `dp[i][j]` if the new state is reachable and offers more mana points than previously recorded.

The maximum number of birds that can be summoned is determined by tracking the highest `j` (total birds summoned) for which there's a valid state (i.e., `dp[n][j]` is not `-1`) across all nests.

Translation steps:
1. **Data structure translation**: Translate the 2D array `dp` and the arrays `c` and `cost` into Rust using `Vec<Vec<i64>>` for `dp` and `Vec<i32>` for `c` and `cost`.

2. **Input translation**: Use Rust's `io::stdin()` for input, parsing the initial parameters and the arrays `c` and `cost`.

3. **Initialization of `dp`**: Instead of using `memset`, manually initialize the `dp` vector in Rust, setting `dp[0][0]` to `W` and all other values to `-1`.

4. **Iterative DP calculation**: Translate the nested loops for the DP calculation directly, taking care to properly translate index arithmetic and use Rust's `max` and `min` functions.

5. **Output**: Use `println!` to print the maximum number of birds that can be summoned, based on the calculation results stored in `dp`.

This translation will maintain the logic and functionality of the original C++ program while adhering to Rust's syntax and idiomatic practices.

Error Explanation:
The failure in the unit test suggests that the logic to update `dp[i][j]` and `ans` might not accurately reflect the conditions under which a new maximum number of birds can be summoned, or there might be an issue with how the dynamic programming states are transitioned and updated.

One potential issue could be related to not correctly updating the `dp` array for all possible states or incorrectly calculating the maximum mana (`max_m`) available after summoning birds from a nest. Additionally, the logic for determining when to update `ans` might not accurately capture the highest possible number of birds that can be summoned based on the available mana.

Repair Plan:
1. **Review and adjust the DP updating logic**: Ensure that the logic correctly updates the `dp[i][j]` states based on whether summoning more birds from the current nest is possible given the mana constraints. This includes ensuring that `new_m` calculation and comparisons are correctly implemented.

2. **Correctly calculate `max_m`**: Verify that the `max_m` calculation reflects the maximum mana available after potentially summoning birds from the current nest. This may require adjustment to ensure it accurately represents the problem's constraints.

3. **Ensure proper iteration and state transitions**: Revisit the nested loops, especially the conditions under which `dp[i][j]` and `ans` are updated. This involves ensuring that for each nest `i` and each possible number of birds `j`, the program correctly considers all viable numbers of birds `k` that can be summoned from nest `i` given the mana constraints.

4. **Adjust the condition for updating `ans`**: Make sure that `ans` is updated not just when `dp[i][j]` is updated, but also based on the correct conditions that reflect the problem statement, ensuring that it represents the maximum number of birds that can be summoned.

Following this plan requires a detailed review and potential adjustment of the dynamic programming logic to ensure that it correctly implements the problem's requirements and accurately updates the dynamic programming states and the answer (`ans`) based on the inputs.

Given the nature of the errors and the required repair plan, let's adjust the approach to correctly update the DP table and find the maximum number of birds that can be summoned:

- The critical observation is that `ans` should only be updated when a valid state (`dp[i][j] != -1`) is found for the current `i` (nest) and any `j` (total birds).
- Ensure that the loop conditions and update logic accurately reflect the potential to summon birds and the resulting mana conditions.
- The innermost loop incorrectly increments `max_m` within its body. This increment doesn't align with the logic intended for calculating the new potential mana after summoning birds. The value of `max_m` should be set correctly before this loop and should not change within it.

However, given the complexity and the nature of the original translation error, a more thorough review and rewrite might be necessary to ensure the program functions as expected. The initial translation plan was sound, but subtle logic errors during translation can lead to failures like this.

Given the repair plan and the understanding of the issues identified during the unit test failure, the following Rust code is a revised version intended to address the inaccuracies and ensure it passes the given test cases:

```rust
use std::cmp::{max, min};
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_to_string(&mut input).unwrap();

    let mut iter = input.split_whitespace();
    let n: usize = iter.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let w: i64 = iter.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let b: i64 = iter.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let x: i64 = iter.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();

    let c: Vec<i64> = (0..n).map(|_| iter.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap()).collect();
    let cost: Vec<i64> = (0..n).map(|_| iter.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap()).collect();

    let mut dp: Vec<Vec<i64>> = vec![vec![-1; 10010]; n + 1];
    dp[0][0] = w;
    let mut ans = 0;

    for i in 1..=n {
        for j in 0..10010 {
            if dp[i - 1][j] == -1 {
                continue;
            }
            for k in 0..=min(j as i64, c[i - 1]) {
                let new_m = min(w + (j as i64 - k) * b, dp[i - 1][j - k as usize] + x) - k * cost[i - 1];
                if new_m >= 0 {
                    if dp[i][j] < new_m {
                        dp[i][j] = new_m;
                    }
                    ans = max(ans, j as i64);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    println!("{}", ans);
}
```

This version makes sure to:

- Initialize `dp` correctly and set `dp[0][0]` to `W` to signify the initial mana points available.
- Iterate through each nest (`i`) and each possible number of total birds summoned so far (`j`), checking and updating the `dp` table for each possible number of birds to summon from the current nest (`k`).
- Calculate the new mana (`new_m`) that would be left after trying to summon `k` birds from nest `i`, considering both the cost of summoning and the mana restoration when moving to the next tree.
- Update `dp[i][j]` if the new state is valid (i.e., `new_m >= 0`) and offers more mana than previously recorded for that state.
- Keep track of the maximum number of birds (`ans`) that can be summoned based on valid DP states.

This code aims to correct the logic flaws in the initial translation and ensure accurate simulation of the dynamic programming approach described in the original C++ code.

#### assistant

Program description:
The provided C++ code is a solution to a dynamic programming problem involving summoning birds from nests using a limited amount of mana, which can be restored and increased under certain conditions. The code defines the variables `n` (number of nests), `W` (initial mana points), `B` (mana capacity increase per bird summoned), and `X` (mana points restored when moving to the next nest). It also uses two arrays: `c[]` to store the number of birds in each nest and `cost[]` to store the mana cost to summon a bird from each nest.

The core of the solution uses a 2D dynamic programming array `dp[][]`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum mana points available after considering the first `i` nests and summoning `j` birds in total. The algorithm initializes `dp` with `-1` to indicate unreachable states, except for `dp[0][0]` which is set to `W` (initial mana points).

For each nest (`i`) and for each possible total number of summoned birds (`j`), it calculates the maximum mana points that can be achieved (`max_m`) and iterates through the number of birds that can be summoned from the current nest (`k`). It then calculates the new mana points (`new_m`) after summoning `k` birds from the current nest and updates the `dp` array with the maximum value between its current value and `new_m`, while also adjusting for the mana capacity increase (`B`) and mana restoration (`X`).

Finally, it prints the maximum number of birds (`ans`) that can be summoned, which is determined by finding the highest `j` for which `dp[n][j]` is not `-1`.

Translation steps:
1. **Dynamic Array Translation**: Rust does not have a direct equivalent of C++'s stack-allocated arrays with predefined sizes for dynamic programming. We'll use `Vec<Vec<i64>>` for the `dp` matrix and `Vec<i32>` for `c` and `cost`.

2. **Input Handling**: Use `std::io` library in Rust for input operations. Rust requires explicit error handling which can be managed using `.expect()` for simplicity in this context.

3. **Initialization of `dp`**: Rust does not have a direct equivalent to `memset` for initializing arrays. We'll use nested loops or functional iterators for initializing the `dp` matrix.

4. **Looping and Logic Translation**: The nested loop structure and logic will be directly translated to Rust, adjusting for Rust's syntax and zero-based indexing.

5. **Handling Min/Max Functions**: Rust's standard library provides `min` and `max` functions, which can be used similarly to C++ but require explicit namespace resolution (`std::cmp::{min, max}`).

6. **Output**: Use `println!` macro for printing the output in Rust.

timeout


#### assistant

Error Explanation:
The program encounters a timeout error because the innermost loop iterates through all possible values of `k`, up to `min(j, c[i])`, for every `(i, j)` pair. This approach is inefficient, especially for large inputs, causing the program to exceed the time limit. The issue is exacerbated when large numbers are involved, as it significantly increases the number of computations.

Repair Plan:
To address the timeout issue, we must optimize the dynamic programming (DP) approach. The primary goal is to reduce the number of unnecessary computations, especially within nested loops. Here are steps to improve the performance:

1. **Limit the Outer Loop Range**: The loop iterating over `j` (total birds summoned) can be limited to the actual maximum possible number of birds that can be summoned up to the current point, instead of iterating up to a hardcoded value (10010). This range can be dynamically calculated based on the birds available in nests processed so far.

2. **Optimize DP State Transitions**: Re-examine the DP state transitions to minimize redundant calculations. Specifically, look for ways to compute `dp[i][j]` more efficiently, potentially by leveraging previously computed values in a manner that avoids iterating over all possible `k` values directly.

3. **Avoid Deeply Nested Loops When Possible**: While the nested loop structure is inherent to the problem's DP formulation, ensuring that the ranges of these loops are as tight and relevant to the problem's constraints as possible will help minimize unnecessary iterations.

These optimizations aim to reduce the computational complexity per state update within the DP table, thus addressing the timeout issue for large inputs.

#### assistant

Given the constraints of the problem and the need to avoid a direct nested loop approach that leads to timeouts, a more efficient solution can be complex due to the optimization required for handling large inputs efficiently in Rust. The adjustments include rethinking the DP update strategy to avoid iterating through all possible `k` values where not necessary and limiting the range of the outer loops to the maximum possible number of birds. However, providing an optimized solution that significantly deviates from the original approach while ensuring it meets all test cases without introducing new concepts or algorithms beyond the original code's scope is challenging within the given format.

The original approach's main issue leading to a timeout is the extensive computation caused by iterating up to `10010` and checking each possible `k` value up to `c[i]`. A direct translation with a straightforward optimization attempt might not suffice due to the problem's inherent computational complexity and the input size. Optimization often requires a deeper understanding of the problem dynamics and potentially introducing new DP states or pre-computations that reduce the need for exhaustive iteration.

Reworking the solution to address these limitations while staying true to the original problem-solving approach would involve:

1. **Dynamic Limiting of Loop Ranges**: Dynamically adjusting the range for the `j` loop based on the sum of `c[i]` values processed so far, to avoid iterating over impossible states.
2. **Efficient State Transitions**: Implementing a more efficient method for updating `dp[i][j]` that reduces or eliminates the need to iterate through all `k` values for each `(i, j)` pair.
3. **Utilizing Additional Data Structures**: Potentially using additional data structures or pre-computed values that help in quickly determining the next valid state without exhaustive search.

Given these considerations and the complexity of implementing such optimizations correctly without specific hints towards an intended optimized approach within the original problem context, providing a fully optimized Rust solution that adheres to the above plan is impractical in this format. The correct optimization often depends on insights specific to the problem's nature and constraints, which might require approaches or algorithms not covered in the original submission.

Given the constraints and to address the challenges in the direct translation and optimization path outlined, here is an approach to avoid the timeout issue by optimizing the loop ranges and DP state transitions. Please note, due to the complexity of the required optimizations, the solution simplifies certain aspects while attempting to stay within the original problem-solving framework. However, due to the limitations in directly optimizing without specific domain insights or reshaping the algorithm significantly, the provided code aims to demonstrate a conceptual approach towards optimization.

```rust
use std::io::{self, Read};
use std::cmp::{min, max};

fn main() {
    let mut input = String::new();
    io::stdin().read_to_string(&mut input).expect("Failed to read input");

    let mut iter = input.split_whitespace();
    let n: usize = iter.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let w: i64 = iter.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let b: i64 = iter.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();
    let x: i64 = iter.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap();

    let c: Vec<i32> = (0..n)
        .map(|_| iter.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap())
        .collect();

    let cost: Vec<i64> = (0..n)
        .map(|_| iter.next().unwrap().parse().unwrap())
        .collect();

    let mut dp = vec![vec![-1i64; 10010]; n + 1];
    dp[0][0] = w;
    let mut ans = 0;

    for i in 1..=n {
        for j in 0..=ans + c[i - 1] as usize {
            let max_m = w + j as i64 * b;
            for k in 0..=min(j as i32, c[i - 1]) {
                if dp[i - 1][j - k as usize] == -1 {
                    continue;
                }
                let new_m = min(
                    w + (j - k as usize) as i64 * b,
                    dp[i - 1][j - k as usize] + x,
                ) - k as i64 * cost[i - 1];
                if new_m >= 0 {
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], min(max_m, new_m));
                    ans = max(ans, j);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    println!("{}", ans);
}
```

This solution attempts to address the timeout issue by optimizing the range of the loops. The optimization process involves limiting the `j` loop to a more reasonable range based on the maximum possible number of birds that can be summoned, given the birds available in nests processed so far (`ans + c[i - 1] as usize`). However, this approach, while conceptual, might still not entirely overcome the computational complexity for all test cases, especially for very large inputs, without more significant algorithmic changes.

Program description:
The given C++ code is an implementation of a dynamic programming solution to solve a problem related to summoning birds. The problem statement involves an initial amount of mana (W), a mana capacity increase after each bird summon (B), a mana restoration on moving from one tree to another (X), and two arrays: `c[i]` representing the number of birds in the i-th nest and `cost[i]` representing the mana cost to summon a bird from the i-th nest. The goal is to find the maximum number of birds that can be summoned.

Key aspects of the program:
1. **Initialization of a 2D dynamic programming array `dp`**: This array stores the maximum mana that can be achieved at every state. It is initially filled with -1 to indicate unvisited states.

2. **Input**: It reads several variables (`n`, `W`, `B`, `X`) and two arrays (`c[]` for number of birds per nest and `cost[]` for mana cost per bird) from the standard input.

3. **Dynamic programming logic**: The program iterates over each nest (`i`), and for each nest, it iterates over all possible summoning scenarios (`j`). For each scenario, it tries summoning `k` birds from the current nest, ensuring that the mana cost does not exceed the available mana.

4. **Result calculation**: It updates the `dp` array with the maximum mana possible after summoning `k` birds from the i-th nest and moving to the i+1-th nest. It also keeps track of the maximum number of birds that can be summoned (`ans`).

5. **Output**: Finally, it outputs the maximum number of birds that can be summoned.

Translation steps:
1. **Translate global variables to local scope**: Rust encourages the use of local scope variables over global ones for safety and clarity.

2. **Replace C++ I/O with Rust's I/O**: Rust uses the `std::io` module for input and output operations. We will use this for reading inputs.

3. **Handling the 2D dynamic programming array**: Rust does not support fixed-size global arrays with non-constant expressions. We will initialize the `dp` array dynamically inside the function.

4. **Replace `memset` with Rust array initialization**: Rust does not have `memset`. We will initialize the `dp` array using Rust idioms.

5. **Iterative dynamic programming implementation**: The core logic of iterating through nests, possible summoning scenarios, and updating the DP table remains similar but adapted to Rust's syntax and types.

6. **Rust functions**: We'll encapsulate the program logic within Rust functions, adhering to Rust's ownership and borrowing rules.

Let's proceed with the translation.

Error Explanation:
The issue likely arises from the logic implemented for updating and checking the DP array and the final answer calculation. Specifically, the conditions under which the DP array is updated and how the `max_m` variable is used might not correctly reflect all possible scenarios where birds can be summoned, especially considering the mana restoration and capacity increase mechanics.

In the original logic, `max_m` is recalculated for each bird and used to limit the new mana value. However, the recalculation of `max_m` within the innermost loop seems incorrect because it does not accurately represent the maximum mana possible after each summoning. The original intention was to ensure `max_m` reflects the current state's maximum mana, but incrementing it inside the loop leads to an unrealistic value that doesn't correspond to any actual game state. This might cause the program to incorrectly calculate the maximum number of birds that can be summoned.

Repair Plan:
1. **Remove Increment of `max_m` Within the Inner Loop**: The increment of `max_m` within the loop doesn't accurately reflect the game's mechanics and should be removed. The value of `max_m` should only depend on the current number of birds summoned (`j`) and the base mana capacity increase rate (`b`).

2. **Proper Update Mechanism for DP Array**: Ensure that the DP array is updated correctly by checking against the current state's mana value, not an artificially incremented `max_m`. This ensures that every possible summoning scenario is considered accurately.

3. **Correctly Calculate the Answer**: The answer (`ans`) should reflect the maximum number of birds that can be summoned across all nests. Ensure that the logic for updating `ans` accurately reflects this by being placed correctly within the loops and checking the right conditions.

4. **Adjust Iteration Limits for Efficiency**: Although not directly related to the error, iterating up to `10010` for every `i` and `j` might be unnecessarily large for some inputs. Consider dynamically adjusting these limits based on the input to optimize performance. However, for simplicity, we will keep this part as is since it does not affect correctness.

Let's apply the repair plan to adjust the provided Rust code accordingly.
